named in honor of our cad prgram , fusion 360

# Instructions

1. Clone repo inside your workspaces src directory (Ex. phnx_ws/src)
2. `rosdep install --from-paths . --ignore-src -r -y` to install deps
3. `colcon build` to make sure the repo builds before you mess with it
4. Replace the following in both file names and code exactly and consistently. 
   1. mult_path_fuser_360: Replace with the package name. Use snake case. Ex. `mult_path_fuser_360`
   2. TODO_PACKAGE_NAME: Replace with the node name. Use Pascal case. Ex. `multPathFuser360`
5. `colcon build` again. If it builds, you are done
6. Rename outer folder
7. Review the optional dependencies, and remove what you do not need

# Dependencies

These are marked with TODO_EXTRA.

mult_path_fuser_360_node: Source files for the ROS2 node object itself, and only itself

mult_path_fuser_360.cpp: Source for the main function of the node, and only the main function

tests/unit.cpp: Example file for unit tests. This is linked to the node and ros, so both can be used
